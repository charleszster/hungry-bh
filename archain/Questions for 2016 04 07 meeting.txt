- central black hole is smaller than guest black holes, at least in the beginning.
- only way for RCORE newton function to work is by updating potential energy all the time.
- How do I update the binding potential when RGAL<RCORE?  Do I:
	1. Update potential only using the potential energy function?, or
	2. Update potential using potential energy function and subtract DELTAW?

Need to:
- Add black holes at respective infall times and effective radii, with random position and sigma components.
- need to update mass of central black hole with time.
- question: if black hole makes it to center (RGAL<=0.2RCORE), what to do with it?
